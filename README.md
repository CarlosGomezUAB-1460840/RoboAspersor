## What it is?

The development team is made up of 3rd year information engineering students. This project has been developed for the subject of Robotics Language and Planning.

Currently on the market there are many robot vacuum cleaners such as the rumba among others, but there is none that is capable of autonomously watering a garden. We have designed a robot, with a budget of 100, capable of watering the garden and taking care of the watering of the different types of plants.

This is our solution

## Description

RoboAspersor is an autonomous robot that waters the plants of a garden. It is able to recognize differnt types of flowers to adjust the amount of watering.

The robot body has been created using the tinkercad tool. It is made up of different parts:

- A watertight area to encapsulate electronic elements such as the Raspberry Pi,
- the water tank that stores water for irrigation,
- the lower part where the servomotors and the caterpillar go,
- and the Sprinkler.

## Requeriments
For runniung each sample code:
We use a development environment created in anaconda navigator to be able to run the robot

- Python 3.9.x
- CoppeliaSim Edu
- Miniconda 
- Anaconda Navigator
- Jupyter notebook
- Numpy
- TensorFlow

For developement:

- TensorFlow (for IA)
- Sim (for connect to Coppelia)
- And other libraries like (Time, sys, random, skimage.io)+
- TinkerCad (for 3D model)
