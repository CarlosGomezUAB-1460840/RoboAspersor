## What it is?

The development team is made up of 3rd year information engineering students. This project has been developed for the subject of Robotics Language and Planning.

Currently on the market there are many robot vacuum cleaners such as the rumba among others, but there is none that is capable of autonomously watering a garden. We have designed a robot, with a budget of 100, capable of watering the garden and taking care of the watering of the different types of plants.

>This is our solution
